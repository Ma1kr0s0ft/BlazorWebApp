# BlazorWebApp

Build a web app with Blazor WebAssembly and Visual Studio Code

Blazor enables C# developers to leverage their existing skills to build client web applications with C# and .NET.

Imagine youâ€™re building a client-side web application and you already have a talented team of .NET developers. As well, you want to have the option of deploying your web app as a Progressive Web Application so your users can download the app and use it offline.

Blazor allows developers to build front and backend logic for web apps with a common development language, frameworks, and tools. Using the same language for front and backend code can accelerate app development, reduce the complexity of the build pipeline, simplify maintenance, and enable developers to understand and work on both the client and server-side code.
